The project resolved to classify the detected face images into two classes using Haar cascade classifier applied on grayscale images, average hue and saturation features derived in HSV color space, and K-Means, whose result was visualized in a scatter plot with centroids. Experiment tracking, version control, and containerization were well catered for by some tools like WandB, GitHub, and Docker, making it very efficient and reproducible. This showing was highly effective for demonstrating the power of combining image processing and clustering approaches for face categorization.
